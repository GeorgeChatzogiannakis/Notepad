# Notepad

Welcome to this imitation of the Windows 10 'Notepad' widget.<br>
This app hosts a mix of features provided in Microsoft's Windows 10 Notepad app,<br>
combined with some elements of their WordPad app, in a slightly different interface.<br><br>
The features allocated in the submenus are placed similarly to where they are found in the original app,<br>
so navigation through the app feels intuitive and offers the user a nice experience.<br><br>
The features packed in the app are listed below:
