------------------------------------------NOTEPAD-HELP-------------------------------------------
Thanks for downloading this imitation of the Windows 10 Notepad and giving it a try!
I have tried to include all major functionality and features included in the original Windows 
notepad to this app, while giving it its own GUI. All features contained in the sub-menus are 
mentioned below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-File-
The File menu hosts the operations of Creating new files, 
Opening existing ones and Save them in .txt or .rtf formats.
-Edit-
This includes Cut, Copy, Paste and undo, Find, and Find-and-Replace 
functionality and the probably least-used-of-them-all feature, 'Go To Line'.
-Format-
This menu allows control of the wrapping of the text (Switched on by default),
and controls the formatting parameters of the text. The 'Font' sub-menu allows the 
user to choose their desired font family, style and size, and apply them to their text document.
-View-
Controls the visibility of the status bar on the bottom of the window.
-Colors-
This menu sets the font color of text or the background of the text widget
-Help-
Contains this guide and the app's version number.
